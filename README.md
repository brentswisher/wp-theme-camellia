Camellia
===

Camellia, a subtle theme inspired by tea, developed using _s.

Full disclosure: This was a one-off theme that I created for one of my personal sites. 
It is built upon _s and you are free to use it as you would like, but be forewarned that in it's current state it may take some customization depending on your site content. 

It is not a fully-features wordpress theme.

Hopefully, I will be able to come back to this when I have some free time and polish it up for general use.
